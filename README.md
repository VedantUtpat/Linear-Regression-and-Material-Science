# Linear-Regression-and-Material-Science
Linear Regression algorithm is used to develop various models of Cast Aluminium alloys for predicting the different mechanical properties like UTS, Fatigue strength, Yield strength etc. The evaluation is carried by applying Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE), Coeff. of Correlation(r) etc.
